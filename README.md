I created this by using controllers and C# methods to create my reverse arrays.

Since the data type for Odd or Even and Reverse Number is int it only takes ints but it will throw a error code without a return. Try implamneting a trypase statement and having the parameter data type to be a string so all inputs a valid withput an error.

 [HttpPost] can be [HttpGet] since no data is being saved.
 
 Unnecessary to declare variables in Controller when we have a sevice file.
 
 Routing should have a /{item} in all routes that require an input so you can't use them without an input. Also not sure if Routes should have spaces ie. when you use [Route("Input here")].
 
Overall good effort. All the logic and structure is there
